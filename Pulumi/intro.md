# Step 1: Introduction to Pulumi and Multi-Cloud Deployments

## Intended Learning Outcomes:
- Learn how to deploy infrastructure on multiple cloud platforms (AWS and Azure) using Pulumi.
- Understand the importance of using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in DevOps for automating infrastructure across clouds.
- Write Pulumi programs using Python or TypeScript.

### Why Pulumi?
Pulumi allows you to use familiar programming languages (like Python, TypeScript) to manage infrastructure, making it developer-friendly. It supports multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP), giving flexibility in cloud infrastructure management.

### Why Multi-Cloud?
Multi-cloud infrastructure allows companies to spread workloads across different cloud providers, reducing risk and offering redundancy in case of outages.

In this scenario, youâ€™ll use Pulumi to create a simple multi-cloud setup, deploying resources on both AWS and Azure.

### Tools You Will Use:
- Pulumi (for IaC)
- AWS and Azure (cloud providers)
- Python or TypeScript (for writing Pulumi code)
