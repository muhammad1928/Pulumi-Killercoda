## Step 2.2: Configure AWS and Azure Providers
Pulumi uses cloud credentials to interact with cloud platforms. In this tutorial, youâ€™ll configure AWS and Azure providers. We will use pre-configured credentials stored in the environment.

## AWS Setup
Run the following command to configure AWS as a Pulumi provider:

```bash
pulumi config set aws:region us-west-2

```

## Azure Setup
```bash
pulumi config set azure:location WestUS

```

Once both providers are set up, you are ready to write your Pulumi program. Move to the next step!
